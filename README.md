also the minecraft server that this was even made for isn't even a thing anymore lol


# Lost-n-Found
A tool for Minecraft which takes a screenshot when the inventory is opened. Mainly created for the eaglercraft server PrimCraft to combat losing items during a crash/restart.

# How To Use
1. Download the project code and unzip the .zip file you get
2. Download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and put it in your PATH if it isn't already in there
3. cd into the directory where the project code is in Command Prompt or any other terminal you have
4. run 'python lostfound.py' or 'py lostfound.py' in the terminal
5. Play the game and this tool will screenshot when the inventory is opened. The screenshots will be saved in the folder where 'lostfound.py' is located

# Stuff
To close this tool press f12

# Limitations
Since this program just takes screenshots when you press 'e', it will take screenshots of random stuff. For example if you send in the Minecraft chat "ahhh help i am about to die" while the program is running, then two screenshots will be taken because there are two 'e's in that message. This will be fixed when i stop being lazy
